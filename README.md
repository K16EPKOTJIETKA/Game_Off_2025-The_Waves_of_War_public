Humanity has long moved beyond Earth’s orbit and mastered most of the Solar System.

The most important hub became the Asteroid Belt, filled with mining stations, cities carved inside rock, and major transit ports between Earth, Mars, and the distant colonies on Saturn’s moons.

For many years the Belt was controlled by Earth, paying high taxes and enduring constant inspections. But in the year X789 its people realized that Earth needed the Belt, not the other way around.
This was the beginning of the Asteroid Belt’s war for independence.

At this critical moment you arrive at a secret station. Your mission is to intercept signals, uncover hidden information, and immediately transmit it to the Free Asteroid Belt Coalition.

Only your accuracy and reaction speed will decide whether the Asteroid Belt can gain its long awaited freedom.
Your actions will shape the course of the war and the future of the entire Belt.
