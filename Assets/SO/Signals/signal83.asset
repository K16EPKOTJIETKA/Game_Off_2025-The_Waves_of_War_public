  text: "Source: Excalibur Station \nThe hull integrity sensors in Sector 9, beneath
    the habitation compartments, are going crazy. Yesterday's heavy cruiser launch
    has caused welds in the outer hull to come loose. There are microcracks there.
    If someone docks to Airlock 9 with a rigid coupling, a chunk of the wall will
    simply fall out. Lock the docking port."
