  text: "Source: High Hill Station \nRepair Crew 7. We've finished welding the VIP
    sector's outer airlock, but we're out of sealant. We've left a temporary plug.
    It's barely hanging on. If anyone from outside pulls the emergency release lever,
    the hatch will just fly out. Don't tell the brass; we'll finish it tomorrow."
