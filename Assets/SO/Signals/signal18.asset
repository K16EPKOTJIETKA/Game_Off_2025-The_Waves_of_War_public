  text: "The Asteroid Belt is a vital part of our shared civilization. Under Earth\u2019s
    leadership, stations were built, technologies were developed, and transport routes
    were secured. Today, Coalition radicals are trying to destroy this order. Do
    not fall for their empty slogans. They promise freedom, but bring only chaos.
    Earth offers stability, a future, and confidence in tomorrow."
