  message: "Excellent work, fighter for freedom. Thanks to you, we were able to conduct
    an operation on Pallas and obtain Earth's technology. The cherished goal is getting
    closer.\n\nIt is time to knock the sword out of the king's hands by destroying
    the largest Earth outpost in the Belt \u2013 the \"Excalibur\" station. This
    operation is very dangerous, and one wrong step can lead to failure and great
    losses.\n\nWe are counting on you.\n\nThe Free Belt Coalition"
