  message: 'The Coalition did it! We were able to destroy the "Excalibur" station.
    The operation went perfectly, losses were minimal. And all thanks to you, fighter
    for freedom!


    Now we can prove to Earth that we should be reckoned with.
    The Coalition will send diplomats for negotiations with the Earthlings. Until
    then, wait for further instructions.


    The Free Belt Coalition'
