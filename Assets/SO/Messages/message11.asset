  message: 'We were able to damage the "Excalibur" station, but destroying it completely
    turned out to be beyond our power. The Belt lost many excellent and loyal fighters
    in this battle.


    The chances of negotiating with the Earth are small, but
    we will try. The Coalition will send diplomats for negotiations with the Earthlings.
    Until then, wait for further instructions.


    The Free Belt Coalition'
