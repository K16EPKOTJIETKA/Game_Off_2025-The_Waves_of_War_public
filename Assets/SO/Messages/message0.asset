  message: "We are happy to welcome you to the station, fighter for freedom. You
    have proven yourself excellently as a radio operator, and we hope that thanks
    to your skills, we will be able to bring our independence closer. Through this
    channel, we will maintain communication and transmit instructions.\n\nYour task
    is to intercept and send any information that may be useful to the Coalition.
    The first goal is the \"Build&Fly\" shipyard. Without a fleet and the ability
    to repair ships, we are doomed to defeat.\n\nGood luck, fighter for freedom.
    \n\nThe Free Belt Coalition"
