  message: 'Thanks to the information received from you, we were able to free part
    of our people from captivity, however, we lost many fighters.


    Now the Coalition
    needs to catch up with the Earth''s technology. Their ships appear out of nowhere,
    their cannons strike more accurately and powerfully, and their radars see farther.
    It''s time to visit a place to which only the Earth has access, and find out
    what is hidden in the shadow of Pallas. However, this object is very well protected,
    so we need a detailed plan. We await useful information from you.


    The Free
    Belt Coalition'
