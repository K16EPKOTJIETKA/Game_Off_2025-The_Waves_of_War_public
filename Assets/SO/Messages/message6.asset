  message: 'Thanks to the information received from you, we were able to successfully
    carry out an operation to free our people from captivity. Good job!


    Now
    the Coalition needs to catch up with the Earth''s technology. Their ships appear
    out of nowhere, their cannons strike more accurately and powerfully, and their
    radars see farther. It''s time to visit a place to which only the Earth has access,
    and find out what is hidden in the shadow of Pallas. However, this place is very
    well protected, so we need a detailed plan. We await useful information from
    you.
