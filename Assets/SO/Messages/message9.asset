  message: "We were able to conduct an operation on Pallas and obtain part of the
    Earth's technology. However, due to lack of information, not all goals were met.
    The cherished goal has gotten a little closer.\n\nIt is time to knock the sword
    out of the king's hands by destroying the largest Earth outpost in the Belt \u2013
    the \"Excalibur\" station. This operation is very dangerous, and one wrong step
    can lead to failure and great losses.\n\nWe are counting on you.\n\nThe Free
    Belt Coalition"
